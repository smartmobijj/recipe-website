        "Step 2: Mix red pepper powder, soy sauce, gochujang, garlic, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Pour into the center of the pot. Sprinkle in green onion. Pour in chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.",
        "Step 3: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add ramen noodles. Cook, stirring until partially cooked and softened, about 2 minutes. Drain, and transfer to the pot with meat-kimchi mixture. Cook, stirring until ramen noodles are tender but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Top stew with American cheese.",
        "Step 4: Anchovy broth can be substituted for the chicken broth if desired."
